WakaTime is a very useful tool for coders to record their workspace times. It records the work time very effectively, including different sections such as Github repository working on, file type working on, programming languages, editors, operating systems, and machines for each day.

The first step to start is to connect your Github account with WakaTime. You can head to the website of WakaTime (<https://wakatime.com/>) and create an account via Github. Click on the button "Log in with Github" and log into Github.

Next, you may want to get the WakaTime API Key. You can click on your PFP at top-right and go into "Settings" for the Secret API Key, or just simply click on this link <https://wakatime.com/api-key/>.

If you are using Visual Studio Code, install the plugin WakaTime from extensions or <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WakaTime.vscode-wakatime>. You can also find this plugin in other editors or IDEs!

Press [Ctrl+Shift+P] and search for "WakaTime". You can select "WakaTime: API Key" from the search bar.
